I am an associate professor in computer science at Bordeaux University and [LaBRI](https://www.labri.fr), member of the teams [Logical foundations of computing](https://lx.labri.fr) and [Synthesis](https://synth.labri.fr).

My **research interests** lie mainly at the interface between algorithms, complexity theory and machine learning.
